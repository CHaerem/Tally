## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### API Limitations
- **Only major Norwegian stocks have live prices** - The following stocks work with Yahoo Finance:
  - EQNR, DNB, TEL, MOWI, YAR, ORK, SALM, NHY, AKRBP, GJF, STB, KOG, TOM, SCATC, SUBC, FRO, GOGL, NAS, BAKKA, LSG, AUSS, GSF
- **Smaller stocks (like SENTI) show "N/A" for prices** - These stocks are not available on free APIs
- **Manual price updates** - For stocks without live data, you can still track them using purchase price
- **CORS restrictions** - Browser security may block some API requests
- **Rate limiting** - Too many requests may temporarily block API access

### Workarounds
- Focus on major Norwegian stocks for live price tracking
- Use the app primarily for portfolio overview and dividend tracking
- Consider running locally with `npm run dev` for better API access
- For comprehensive Norwegian market data, consider professional data services
